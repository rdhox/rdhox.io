Welcome to **rdhox.io**!  
I am a web developer since 2011 and a **freelancer** since 2018. After using the LAMP framework with tools like _Symfony_ and _JQuery_ for the front-end, I've been caught by the **Javascript fever**. At the start I was focusing on front-end development with the **Angular framework** but I'm now more of a **React** guy. As clouds become more friendly to use with framework like [Serverless](https://serverless.com/), I'm starting to play around with them. Things are changing in web development, and you don't want to miss the train!

I develop some open source projects during my free time that you can see on [my github](https://github.com/rdhox/). My activity depends on the periods, sometimes I'm too busy to be a good Open Sourcer!
